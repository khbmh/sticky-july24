          The world can't live without mobile and web applications in this day and age. Everything is digitized, from
          booking cabs to ordering food to make bank transactions. Thanks to the efficient frameworks that provide a
          seamless user experience. One such robust frontend library is React. This tutorial on ‘what is React’ will
          help you understand the library's fundamentals and work with a simple demo.

          React is a framework that employs Webpack to automatically compile React, JSX, and ES6 code while handling CSS
          file prefixes. React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Although React is a library rather than a
          language, it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the
          most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.

          React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native,
          beyond mere UI.

          ReactJS History
          When compared to other technologies on the market, React is a new technology. Jordan Walke, a software
          engineer at Facebook, founded the library in 2011, giving it life. The likes of XHP, a straightforward HTML
          component framework for PHP, have an influence on React. React's newsfeed was its debut application in 2011.
          Later, Instagram picks it up and incorporates it into their platform.

        <h1>Why React?</h1>
        <p>
          React’s popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end development frameworks. Here is why:

          Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it
          requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding often gets complex
          very quickly.
          Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares
          the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of
          updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications do.
          Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually
          consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused
          throughout the application, which in turn dramatically reduces the application’s development time.
          Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a React
          app, developers often nest child components within parent components. Since the data flows in a single
          direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where a problem occurs in an application at the moment
          in question.
          Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with
          some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend some time
          to get a proper understanding of React’s library.
          It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps: We already know that React is used for the
          development of web applications, but that’s not all it can do. There is a framework called React Native,
          derived from React itself, that is hugely popular and is used for creating beautiful mobile applications. So,
          in reality, React can be used for making both web and mobile applications.
          Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React
          applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and easier.
          The above reasons more than justify the popularity of the React library and why it is being adopted by a large
          number of organizations and businesses. Now let’s familiarize ourselves with React’s features.</p>
